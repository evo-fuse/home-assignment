# **React Native Developer Home Assignment**

## **Objective**

We are looking for a React Native developer to demonstrate their skills in integrating a MetaMask wallet and transferring USDT across multiple blockchain networks (ETH, POL, BNB) with error handling and smooth switching between networks.

## **Functionality Requirements**

The app should consist of **two sections**:

1. **Connect MetaMask:**

   * Implement a **Connect** button that connects the MetaMask wallet to the mobile app using **Reown**, **Ethers**, and **Web3** modules.
   * Ensure that the MetaMask connection is seamless and reliable.

2. **Transaction Functionality:**

   * Provide a text field **Amount** to enter the transaction amount (in USDT).
   * Provide a dropdown/select menu to **choose a Blockchain Network** (ETH, POL, BNB).
   * Provide a text field **Address** where the user can enter the recipient’s wallet address.
   * Implement a **Send** button that, when clicked, transfers the entered amount of USDT to the entered address on the selected blockchain network (ETH, POL, or BNB).
   * The app should communicate with the respective blockchain and perform the transaction securely.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

* **Code Quality:**

  * The code should be structured, clean, and reusable. Aim for scalability and maintainability.
  * Use best practices for error handling, especially around network connectivity and transaction failures.
  * Provide meaningful comments and documentation for your code.

* **Blockchain Network Switching:**

  * Ensure smooth switching and adding between ETH, POL, and BNB networks.
  * Handle the addition of new networks easily, should that be required in the future.

* **Error Handling:**

  * Implement proper error handling for wallet connection issues, transaction errors, and network issues.
  * Provide feedback to users on the status of their transactions (success, failure, pending).

* **AI Usage (Optional):**

  * If you use AI tools during development, please submit the AI model and prompts used.

## **Submission Details**

* Complete the assignment and submit the GitHub repository link by **December 27th**.
* The assignment should be submitted as a fully working app that demonstrates the above features.
* Ensure that the code is well-documented and structured for review.

We look forward to reviewing your solution and seeing your skills in action. Best of luck!
